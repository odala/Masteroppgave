# To compile the master thesis:
xelatex main.tex
bibtex main
xelatex main.tex
xelatex main.tex

# Suppose you have main.tex (and main.bib, I have references.bib. Work as well)
# You need to run:

xelatex main.tex (generate a document with question marks in place of unknown references)
bibtex main      (parse all the .bib files that were included in the article and generate metainformation regarding references)
xelatex main.tex (generate document with all the references in the correct places)
xelatex main.tex (just in case if adding references broke page numbering somewhere)
