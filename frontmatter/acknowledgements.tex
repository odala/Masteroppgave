I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Randi Haakenaasen for the valuable discussions and guidance during my project work. I would also like to thank my professors at NTNU for their inspiring lectures and discussions, and my co-supervisor Associate Professor Turid Worren Reenaas for making time for me in her already busy schedule.

The work has been carried out in co-operation with the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) at Kjeller. I would like to thank Espen Selvig for his patient advice and follow up in the development of this work, Laila Trosdahl-Iversen for useful guidance during transfer of samples, and Torgeir Lorentzen for helping me when the machines did not work properly.
