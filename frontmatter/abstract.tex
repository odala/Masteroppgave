% Here you give a summary of your work and your results. This is like a management summary and should be written in a clear and easy language, without many difficult terms and without abbreviations. Everything you present here must be treated in more detail in the main report. You should not give any references to the report in the summary - just explain what you have done and what you have found out. Should NOT be more than two pages!

\begin{abstract}
In this study, four \ac{czt} substrates were characterised for surface impurity contamination, particles, and defects. Three $30\times$\SI{30}{\milli\metre^2} (111)B-oriented substrates from two different vendors and one $15\times$\SI{15}{\milli\metre^2} (211)B-oriented substrate were examined both as-received and after surface pre-growth preparation. As the final step, a layer of \ac{mct} film was grown on each substrate and examined. The characterisation consisted of a study by optical microscopy, \ac{sem} with \ac{eds}, \ac{afm}, near-\ac{ir} transmission microscopy, and \ac{ftir}. The study was motivated by the desire to obtain a better understanding of how impurities, defects, and particles on the \ac{czt} substrate surface affect the quality of the semiconducting material \ac{mct}, which was grown by \ac{lpe} on the (111)B-oriented substrates and by \ac{mbe} on the (211)B-oriented substrate.

%The substrates were then subjected to different surface pre-growth preparations. The third $30\times$\SI{30}{\milli\metre^2} (111)B-oriented substrate was a replacement for the second substrate, which broke during this characterisation step. %The state-of-the-art (111)B-oriented substrate was subjected to \ac{lpe} preparation etch, the (111)B-oriented substrates were subjected to \ac{lpe} preparation polish and etch, while the state-of-the-art (211)B-oriented substrate was subjected to \ac{mbe} preparation etch.
