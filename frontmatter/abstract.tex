% Here you give a summary of your work and your results. This is like a management summary and should be written in a clear and easy language, without many difficult terms and without abbreviations. Everything you present here must be treated in more detail in the main report. You should not give any references to the report in the summary - just explain what you have done and what you have found out. Should NOT be more than two pages!

\begin{abstract}
In this study, four \ac{czt} as-received substrates were characterised for surface impurity contamination, particles, and defects. Three $30\times$\SI{30}{\milli\metre^2} (111)B-oriented substrates from two different vendors and one $15\times$\SI{15}{\milli\metre^2} (211)B-oriented substrate were analysed. The substrates were studied by optical microscopy, \ac{sem} with \ac{eds}, \ac{afm}, near-\ac{ir} transmission microscopy, and \ac{ftir}. 

\todo{What was observed?} 

The substrates were then subjected to different surface pre-growth preparations. The third $30\times$\SI{30}{\milli\metre^2} (111)B-oriented substrate was a replacement for the second substrate, which broke during this characterisation step. %The state-of-the-art (111)B-oriented substrate was subjected to \ac{lpe} preparation etch, the (111)B-oriented substrates were subjected to \ac{lpe} preparation polish and etch, while the state-of-the-art (211)B-oriented substrate was subjected to \ac{mbe} preparation etch.

\Ac{mct} epitaxial layers were grown by \ac{lpe} on the (111)B-oriented substrates and by \ac{mbe} on the (211)B-oriented substrate.
