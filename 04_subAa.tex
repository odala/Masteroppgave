\chapter{Results and Discussion}\label{ch:results-and-discussion}
In this chapter, experimental results are presented, analysed, and discussed. In total, one (111)B substrate from vendor A (substrate A), two (111)B substrates from vendor B (substrate B and substrate B2), and one (211)B substrate from vendor A (substrate C) were investigated\andreas{du skriver analysed i første setningen. burde du ikke skrive det her også da?} using bright and dark field microscopy, \ac{sem}, \ac{eds}, \ac{afm}, near-\ac{ir} transmission microscopy, and \ac{ftir}. Except for substrate B2, which was only\andreas{fjerne only} investigated after surface pre-growth preparation, the substrates were investigated both as-received and after surface pre-growth preparation \andreas{det er ingenting feil med innskutt bisetning her, men synes det ble litt rart å lese. Hva med "The substrates were investigated both as-received and after surface pre-growth preparation, excpet substrate B2, which was analysed after surface pre-growth preparation."?}. As the final step, \iac{mct} film was grown on each substrate (except for the shattered substrate B)\andreas{på bacheloroppgaven fikk vi beskjed om at hvis det var så uviktig at det skulle stå parentes, så skulle vi ha det fotnote istedenfor. Eller legge det inn i teksten om det bør leses av leseren.} and the same characterisation as for the substrates was carried out\andreas{conducted} to correlate\andreas{compare?} the number of defects and \andreas{the} type of defects in the grown \ac{mct} layer with the preparation of the substrate.

\section{Surface Analysis of As-Received Substrate A}\label{sec:subAa}
% Substrate A
In previous work \citep{lauten2017characterisation}, the state-of-the-art as-received (111)B-oriented substrate A was characterised for polishing damage, defects, and residual particles using optical microscopy, \ac{sem} with \ac{eds}, and \ac{xps}. The results are\andreas{were} reiterated in this section to better present the full scope of the study. In addition to the previously used methods, \ac{afm}, near-\ac{ir} transmission microscopy, and \ac{ftir} were used to study the as-received substrate.

Here the particle and morphological defect density refers\andreas{refer} to the sum of all light scattering objects with sizes \SI{>0.5}{\micro\metre} since any particles or morphological defects that have sizes \SI{<0.5}{\micro\metre} are\andreas{were} not seen in the dark field images.

Substrates from vendor A are\andreas{were} considered to be state-of-the-art \ac{czt} subtrates\andreas{glemt en "s"?}. They are\andreas{were} fine-polished by the vendor, and hence\andreas{consequently}, they have\andreas{had} few surface features.

At a magnification of $100\times$ it was not possible to see any particles or defects at all\andreas{no particles or defects could be seen/detected}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:EDX_BZ1503A_a_m001}. It was easier to find focus near the edges of the substrate. This was probably due to a higher occurrence of particles\andreas{As a result of higher occurrence of particles, it was easier to find focus near the edges of the substrate.}.

% A particle and morphological defect density of features \SI{>0.5}{\micro\metre} of \SI{4e2}{\centi\metre^{-2}} at the centre and \SI{1e3}{\centi\metre^{-2}} at the edges of the substrate was observed. Substrate A had polishing scratches that were between 10 and \SI{20}{\nano\metre} wide. In addition, pieces of residual polishing grit was found on the surface. An \ac{eds} spectrum of an agglomeration of multiple particles revealed that they were composed of alumina (\ce{Al2O3}) and silica (\ce{SiO2}) polishing grit. In addition, larger particles with size of \SI{\sim 10}{\micro\metre} on the substrate surface were observed. \Ac{eds} revealed that these particles mainly consisted of titanium.

\subsubsection{Alumina (\ce{Al2O3}) and Silica (\ce{SiO2}) Polishing Grit}
Small particles of size \SI{50}{\nano\metre} were observed near the edges of substrate A, see Fig.~\ref{fig:subAa_polishing-grit}. The \ac{sem} image show an agglomeration of particles and one single particle with a diameter of \SI{50}{\nano\metre}. The large piece is an agglomeration of the smaller ones. The corresponding \ac{eds} spectrum of the large piece reveals that the particles consist of \ce{Al}, \ce{Si} and \ce{O}. The particles are most likely residual \ce{Al2O3} and \ce{SiO2} polishing grit which are commonly used in polishing slurries \citep{benson2015as-received}. 

It seems like the polishing grits are easier to observe near the edges of the substrate and therefore have a higher density towards the edges than further in, but this could also be due to the difficulties of focusing the \ac{sem} beam on the flat surface. The upper limit on the polishing grit density close to the edges of the substrate is estimated from Fig.~\ref{fig:substrateA_a2_m005} to be \SI{3e6}{\particle\centi\metre^{-1}}. Since it was not possible to get any good \ac{sem} images to count the density of polishing grit further in on the substrate, but it can be assumed that the density further in is smaller than \SI{3e6}{\particle\centi\metre^{-1}}.

%%=====
\subsubsection{Silicon Carbide (\ce{SiC}) and Silica (SiO2)}
A particle with a diameter of \SI{200}{\nano\metre} is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:subAa_large-grit} with the corresponding \ac{eds} spectrum. This particle is considerably larger and has a rougher surface than the more frequently observed \SI{50}{\nano\metre} particles that were found to be residual polishing grit. The \ac{eds} spectrum of the particle reveals that the particle consists of \ce{Si}, \ce{C} and \ce{O}, which indicates that also this particle could be residual \ce{SIO2} polishing grit, \ce{SiC} polishing grit, or an agglomeration of both. \todo{Finn atomprosent for å avgjøre. SiC eller SiO2? Hvor kommer C fra hvis bare SiO2?}

\subsubsection{CZT}
Particles with size \SI{>5}{\micro\metre} are observed mainly near the edges of substrate A. Fig.~\ref{fig:subAa_czt-particle} shows a particle that is \SI{13}{\micro\metre} long and \SI{5}{\micro\metre} wide. A comparison between the corresponding \ac{eds} spectrum of the particle and the substrate surface spectrum reveals that the particle consists of the same material as the underlying substrate. It could be debris from the cutting and polishing of the substrate by the vendor.


%%=====
\subsubsection{Titanium}
There are observed particles with sharp edges and sizes \SI{>5}{\micro\metre} in the upper left corner of the substrate. They appear darker than the \ac{czt} particles in \ac{sem} and with more edges. Fig.~\ref{fig:subAa_titanium-particle} shows a particle that is \SI{8}{\micro\metre} long and \SI{4}{\micro\metre} wide. The corresponding \ac{eds} spectrum of the particle reveals that the particle mainly consists of titanium. The sharp edges indicate that the particle has not not been used as polishing grit since the edges had been rounded in that case. Unfortunately, these particles have probably settled on the substrate during the study. It was made a new substrate holder for \ac{xps} measurements out of titanium in the machine shop. When mounting with a screw, some titanium particles were made. They are, however, confined to a small area in the upper left corner of the substrate. \Ac{sem} and \ac{eds} measurements of particles from the \ac{xps} holder, collected with an adhesive carbon tab, confirms that the same type of titanium particles were found on the \ac{xps} holder. %This fact, shows how important it is to clean the equipment carefully before use. %see Fig.~\ref{fig:subAa_titanium}


%%=========================================

\subsection{Surface Scratches and Roughness}
The as-received surface of substrate A was carefully polished by the vendor, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:subAa_scratches}. The surface scratches most likely have shallow depth since they cannot be seen in the dark field images of substrate A, see Fig.~\ref{fig:subAa_om_df}.

\end{figure}

The as-received substrate A was characterised for surface topography by \ac{afm}. Images of $\SI{5}{\micro\metre}\times\SI{5}{\micro\metre}$ areas were taken at three different locations on the substrate surface: near the centre, near the upper edge, and near the upper left corner, as seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:subAa_afm}. The \ac{rms} roughness of substrate A is \SI{\sim0.3}{\nano\metre} at both the centre and around the edges, while it is slightly higher at the corner with \iac{rms} roughness of \SI{\sim0.4}{\nano\metre}. This indicates the absence of large scratches. The typical surface scratches are between \SIrange{10}{20}{\nano\metre} wide and \SI{1}{\nano\metre} deep. While the largest polishing scratches are \SI{0.2}{\micro\metre} wide and \SI{5}{\nano\metre} deep.

\subsection{Impurity Analysis}

\Ac{xps} analysis was performed on the as-received substrate A to determine the composition of the outermost layers of the substrate (\SI{\sim 80}{\angstrom}). The centre of the $\SI{30}{\milli\metre}\times\SI{30}{\milli\metre}$ \ac{czt} wafer was analysed using \ac{xps}. With the large beam size of \SI{1}{\centi\metre}, it should be possible to see traces of impurity elements over a large area, but not locate them to specific particles or small areas. Unfortunately, something was broken on the old analyser, resulting in low signal intensity and no detection of impurities or small concentrations of elements. The ever-present oxide and carbon overlayers further decreased any small signals. Therefore, the XPS only gave information about the following elements: \ce{Te}, \ce{Cd}, \ce{O}, and \ce{C}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:xps_spectra}. The reason for not performing \ac{xps} analysis on substrate B was that it would not be possible to detect the presence of impurities or small concentrations of elements with the \ac{xps} equipment at hand.

The peaks in the spectrum were: \subref{fig:xps_Te3d} \ce{Te} 3d with extra peaks due to tellurium oxide; \subref{fig:xps_Cd3d} \ce{Cd} 3d; \subref{fig:xps_O1s} \ce{O} 1s; and \subref{fig:xps_C1s} \ce{C} 1s.}

The atomic concentrations were calculated using Eq.~\eqref{eq:xps_concentration} with intensity peak areas and the following experimentally measured atomic sensitivity factors, determined earlier at \ac{ffi} \citep{hirsch1999x-ray}: \ce{Cd} 3d\textsubscript{5/2} (0.56), \ce{Te} 3d\textsubscript{5/2} (1.00), \ce{O} 1s (0.13), and \ce{C} 1s (0.05). Table~\ref{tab:xps_results} displays the results of the \ac{xps} analysis of substrate A. \ce{Cd_{0.96}Zn_{0.04}Te} should consist of \SI{48}{\atomic\percent} cadmium, \SI{2}{\atomic\percent} zinc and \SI{50}{\atomic\percent} tellurium, but zinc was not detected and the atomic concentration of \ce{Cd} was only \SI{75}{\percent} of that of \ce{Te} (it should be \SI{96}{\percent}). The higher than expected \ce{Te} concentration can be explained by the formation of a \ce{Te} oxide layer on the surface. By inserting the ratio between \ce{Te} in \ce{Cd_{1-y}Zn_yTe} signal and \ce{Te} in \ce{TeO} signal of \SI{1.3}{} into Eq.~\eqref{eq:signal_ratio}, the \ce{Te} oxide layer thickness was calculated to be \SI{0.96}{\nano\metre}. An atomic concentration of $23.5$ at.\% carbon was found, which can be explained by an overlayer of carbon. \todo{How thick?}

% EDS-analysis
Since the \ac{xps} equipment did not detect small concentrations of elements, \ac{eds} was used to get a quantitative analysis of the chemical composition of the substrate. The spectra were taken using an accelerating voltage of \SI{10.0}{\kilo\volt} to ensure the peaks of interest, a large probe current to maximise the throughput, and a live acquisition time of \SI{1200}{\second} to get good statistics (less noise). The results from the as-received substrate A can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:subAa_eds_analysis}. %an extraction voltage of \SI{2.00}{\kilo\volt} to get 

The electron interaction depth was calculated by the Quantax software to be \SI{0.4}{\micro\metre}. That means that characteristic X-rays from elements as far in as \SI{0.4}{\micro\metre} below the surface were detected. In comparison, the \ac{xps} detects the electrons that escape from the outermost \SI{\sim10}{\nano\metre}. Hence, \ac{eds} is not as surface sensitive and more than just the top surface layer is probed. This is part of the reason for the difference in the atomic concentrations between the \ac{xps} and \ac{eds} results for substrate A. The observed silica and alumina particles have a diameter of about \SI{50}{\nano\metre}. Hence, one monolayer of these would cover \SI{\sim12.5}{\percent} of the interaction volume, but more of the signal.

The \ac{eds} surface analysis identified the following elements: \ce{Cd}, \ce{Te}, \ce{Zn}, \ce{Al}, \ce{Si}, \ce{C}, and \ce{O}. The relative concentrations of \ce{Cd}, \ce{Zn}, and \ce{Te} had an error of less than one percentage point from the expected value of \SI{48}{\atomic\percent} cadmium, \SI{2}{\atomic\percent} zinc and \SI{50}{\atomic\percent} tellurium. There are detected silicon and alumina near the centre as well as near the edges and corners. This indicate that it is polishing grit in the centre as well. %\todo{Kan du si noe om density ut fra dette?}%Substrate A had a smaller atomic concentration of \ce{O} than substrate B, which indicates that the tellurium oxide layer on substrate A was thinner than that on substrate B. The \ce{Al} and \ce{Si} contamination found in the \ac{eds} analysis for both substrate A and substrate B was coming from residual \ce{Al2O3} and \ce{SiO2} polishing grit respectively.

% FTIR transmission spectra.
\subsection{IR Characterisation}

\Ac{ftir} transmission spectra were recorded from an $11\times11$ grid on the as-received substrate A. The grid points were placed \SI{2.0}{\milli\metre} from the edge and had \SI{2.6}{\milli\metre} between nearest neighbours. All but four measurements had an \ac{ir} transmittance between \SI{62}{\percent} and \SI{67}{\percent} in the wavenumber range between \SI{1000}{\centi\metre^{-1}} and \SI{5000}{\centi\metre^{-1}}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:subAa_ftir_spectra}. The spikes near $k=\SI{4500}{\centi\metre^{-1}}$ and $k=\SI{5000}{\centi\metre^{-1}}$ are an artefact of the \ac{ftir} instrument and should not be considered. A map of the transmission at $k=\SI{500}{\centi\metre^{-1}}$ can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:subAa_ftir_map_500cm-1}.

The two factors that are mainly responsible for the reduction in \ac{ir} transmittance of \ac{czt} are the free carrier absorption and the scattering effect of precipitates \citep{yadava1994precipitation}. \citet{yujie2004infrared} used the transmittance at the wavenumber of $\SI{1000}{\centi\metre^{-1}}$ $T_{1000}$, the transmittance at the wavenumber of $\SI{5000}{\centi\metre^{-1}}$ $T_{5000}$, and the ratio of $T_{1000}$ to $T_{5000}$ to determine which of these two mechanisms that are the most significant. Their analysis gives a qualitative determination of the density and size of \ce{Te} precipitates, the free carrier concentration, and the resistivity for \ac{czt} substrates. %\todo{Espen: Dislokasjoner og ruhet vil også senke transmisjon.}

Almost all the spectra from substrate A had a value of $T_{5000}$ between \SI{63}{\percent} and \SI{67}{\percent}, $T_{1000}$ between \SI{62}{\percent} and \SI{64}{\percent}, and $T_{1000}/T_{5000}$ approaches one from below. According to \citet{yujie2004infrared}, the \ac{czt} substrates with these characteristics are free of precipitates, have low free carrier concentration, and have resistivity that exceeds \SI{e6}{\ohm\centi\metre}.%\todo{Why?}
