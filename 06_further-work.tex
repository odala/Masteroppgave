Finne metode for å bli kvitt partikler fra kantene på vendor A substrat alik at de ikke løses opp i etsen og legger seg ned på substratoverflaten. Metode for å etse uten å legge igjen så mye partikler (1) ha en skillevegg i etsebegeret slik at en kan etse i det ene kammeret og så ta opp av væsken på andre siden av en glassvegg. Tendens til at partikler legger seg i overflaten, 2) noen løsemidler er bedre til å ta opp og vekk partikler enn andre.)

Studere lav transmisjon og om det gir lysere områder i SEM og alltid eller bare der p-doping. Mørkere n-doping?

Correlate the density of donuts with the density of tellurium precipitates near the surface.

%A possible extension of this work is to do a characterisation of the substrate surface after different surface treatments. Substrate A will need a surface preparation including a surface etch, while substrate B will need a surface preparation including both polishing of the surface and an etch. A 3rd substrate (substrate C) from a different vendor than the two in this study (vendor C) will be obtained and compared with substrate A and substrate B.

%Then, \ac{lpe} growth of \ce{HgCdTe} should be done on the different substrates. The \ce{HgCdTe} film surface, crystallinity and defects should be studied. It would be of interest to measure the correlations between preparation method and defects in the grown \ce{HgCdTe} layer as well as the correlation between growth conditions and defects in the grown \ce{HgCdTe} layer.

%It would be useful to take use of other techniques to get a more complete characterisation of the surface. An \ac{afm} could be used to characterise the surface topography and morphological defects in the \ce{CdZnTe} surface with more detail than has been achieved with dark field microscopy and \ac{sem} images so far. \ac{afm} is a high resolution scanning probe microscopy technique that can detect height differences on the order of \SI{1}{\nano\metre}. It might be of interest to do a surface sensitive impurity analysis, i.e. \ac{xps} somewhere else with higher signal intensity, to get a qualitative and quantitative compositional measurement of the impurity concentrations of the outermost layers of the substrates.

% The future work section is a place for you to explain to your readers where you think the results can lead you. What do you think are the next steps to take? What other questions do your results raise? Do you think certain paths seem to be more promising than others?
% The goal should not be to go into a bunch of details, but instead just a sentence or two explaining each idea.
