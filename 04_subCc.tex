\subsection{Particles}

\citet{selvig2007defects} describe the irregularly shaped defects with sizes extending from \SI{10}{\micro\metre} to a few hundred microns as high temperature voids, see Fig.~\ref{}, and the ones with size less than \SI{10}{\micro\metre} as microvoids, see Fig.~\ref{}. These types of defects are typically formed during the growth of the material and the density is dependent on the deviation from ideal growth conditions. High temperature voids are formed at substrate temperatures higher than the \ce{Te}-phase limit, while microvoids are formed at low substrate temperature.
